First of all, I would like to thank my wonderful parents, who gave me the support I needed to reach this point in my life, and my wonderful cats - Daphne, Josephine, and Chili (although I doubt they will read this). I am also incredibly grateful to my partner, who helped me immensely through my last year in the University.

I am thankful to the people I met during my internship, with whom I conducted the research presented in this thesis - Jakub, Dimitris, and Eleni, as well as my colleague Illia.

Lastly, I would like to thank all my friends in Padova and across the world, who made the toughest episodes of my life just a little easier.
