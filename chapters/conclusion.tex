The conclusion goes here.

In this work, I have described a novel randomized post-processing algorithm for fairness in rankings that does not use any information about the group membership of the candidates or the values of the protected attributes. The algorithm demonstrated its ability to balance fairness across multiple protected attributes and achieved comparable performance to state-of-the-art when the information about group membership is corrupted by noise. It may be implemented into a ranking pipeline or serve as a proof of concept for achieving fairness through noise injection.

One direction for future work is a rigorous theoretic analysis of the effects of Mallows noise injection on fairness, providing a bound for the values of the most common fairness metrics. This would allow users to tune the parameters of the model depending on the distribution of the values of the protected attributes, improving the algorithm's performance without requiring information about individual candidates' group membership.
